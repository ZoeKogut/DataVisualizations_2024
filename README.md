# DataVisualizations_2024
Repository of classwork for CS439

# Project 1
This was the beginning project and my first step into making and designing graphs. 
The folders in there work with simple bubble and bar charts, along with a splom graph 

# Project 4
This project has its own Readme detailing some of the issues I came accross while doing the project.

Project 4 deals with desplaying data through different datastructures such as trees (regular and radial) and tree maps.

p4_NodeLink should look something like this.
