# DataVisualizations_2024
Repository of classwork for CS439

<ins>**Any data (except for the final project) was compiled and cleaned by Xavier Tricoche**</ins>

## Project 1
This was the beginning project and my first step into making and designing graphs. 
The folders in there work with simple bubble and bar charts, along with a splom graph

### p1_splom
API: python p1_splom.py -i evs_assignment1.xlsx -a attribute

ie. To run the program comparing both weight and range together, you would run:
  
  <ins>python p1_splom.py -i evs_assignment1.xlsx -a Weight -a Range</ins>

Attributes will be listed if you add the **-h** or **--help** tag before **-i**

## Project 4
This project has its own Readme detailing some of the issues I came accross while doing the project.

Project 4 deals with desplaying data through different datastructures such as trees (regular and radial) and tree maps.

p4_NodeLink should look something like this.
- Red means that the node is expanded and has children (Internal node)
- Green means the node is collapsed and has children
- Blue means the node has no children (Leaf)
